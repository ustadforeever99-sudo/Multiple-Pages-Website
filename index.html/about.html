<h2>About Fabrics & Clothes</h2>
<p><em>Fabrics are flexible materials for clothes made from natural (like cotton, silk, wool) or synthetic (like polyester, nylon) fibers, which are spun into yarn and then woven or knitted. Clothing is worn by humans and made from fabrics, animal skin, or other materials, varying by cultural context and geographic location. Different fabrics offer unique properties such as breathability, durability, flexibility, or a specific look and feel, and are chosen for their characteristics to create various garments.</em></p>
